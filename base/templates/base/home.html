                <h4>My Experience as a Developer</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>A seasoned mobile app developer with vast experience in React Native and Kotlin Jetpack Compose, I
                    possess a deep understanding
                    of mobile app development and the nuances involved in building scalable, high-performing, and
                    user-friendly
                    applications. I have worked on numerous projects, ranging from small-scale to enterprise-level,
                    delivering
                    exceptional results to my clients.</p>

                <p>In my years of experience, I have honed my skills in developing mobile apps that seamlessly integrate
                    with
                    various APIs, third-party services, and platforms. I possess a deep understanding of cross-platform
                    mobile app
                    development and have leveraged React Native to build applications for iOS and Android platforms.</p>

                <p>In addition to my development skills, I am proficient in conducting code reviews, identifying bugs
                    and performance
                    bottlenecks, and proposing effective solutions to optimize app performance. I have also mentored
                    junior
                    developers, contributing to their growth and helping them acquire critical skills needed in the
                    industry.</p>

                <p>When the need arises I fly.</p>

                <p>I can learn just about anything by having an urgency and need for it, I can quiakly pick up a new tech
                    such as thie django and kotlin when there is a huge need for it, discovered learning them on my own
                    with no sense of urgency never works .</p>
